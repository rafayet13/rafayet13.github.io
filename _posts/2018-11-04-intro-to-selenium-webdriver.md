Selenium WebDriver is one of the most popular tools for Web UI Automation. And no better than Python can complement it to automate a broad range of web applications. Hence, we brought this Selenium Webdriver Python tutorial to ramp you up quickly on the task. So let’s start by understanding what all we have to do in UI automation testing.

Web UI Automation means the automatic execution of the actions performed in a web browser window like navigating to a website, filling forms that include dealing with text boxes, radio buttons and drop downs, submitting the forms, browsing through web pages, handling pop-ups and so on. Selenium WebDriver is the one that can automate all these tasks. It can interact with all types of Web browsers available till date like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Chrome, etc.

Most of the time, we use Java and Eclipse to create a Selenium Webdriver project. In this post, we’ll use Python to replace Java and demonstrate how the Selenium Webdriver Python integration works to achieve the Web UI automation.

Selenium is an open source, and its library is available in different programming languages to perform the Web UI Automation testing, and Python is one of them.

Selenium WebDriver Client Library for Python enables us to utilize all the features available with Selenium WebDriver and interact with Selenium Standalone Server to perform Automated testing (both remote and distributed testing) of browser-based applications.

It could be relevant for you to know about the team and its members who drove the development of the Selenium WebDriver Python libraries, they are Miki Tebeka, Adam Goucher, Eric Allenin, David Burns, Luke Semerau, Jason Huggins and MaikRoder.

The Selenium Webdriver library is compatible with a series of Python versions that includes Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2-3.5.

 In this course we are gonna learn selenium automation with with python 3
