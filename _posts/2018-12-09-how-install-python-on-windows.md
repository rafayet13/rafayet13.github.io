## Install python on your work Environment 

To install Python, download Python 3.6 (or higher) from  [http://www.python.org]:  .

Once Python is installed, you can execute the program "cmd.exe ". This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word python  and that will start the Python program.

At all points during the course, you can always type python name_of_file.py  and that will execute the code of a file called name_of_file.py .

To install **PyCharm** Python IDE, just download the Community Edition (which is free) from
[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/]: .
