## The best approach is to use an actual coding editor. Some people prefer an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but a far simpler code editor is much better for learning purposes.

Why? When you are learning something new you want to peel off as many layers of complexity as possible. Simplify things. By adding a complex IDE into the mix, which you will have to learn how to operate, you are just adding more and more layers, making the task - learning Python - even more difficult.

(7) Picking a Coding Editor
A Python program, in its basic form, is simply lines of text (code) saved in a file with a .py file extension. Python code can be written in something as basic as Notepad - but there’s no reason to put yourself through such an ordeal since there are much better options available. At it’s core, a code editor should provide a number of features that help a programmer create programs (Python scripts and modules, in our case). In most cases, code editors allow the user to customize the program itself, to suit your needs and style.

- What should you look for in a code editor?
- Ease of use
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-indentation
- Tabbed views
- Line numbering
- Ability to customize the look and feel of the editor
- Availability of add-ons

## Which one should I pick?
I've tried  tens of python IDE over the year. where I found some are very useful & handy.
These are my favourites:
1. Anaconda Python IDE (A complete python IDE)
2. PyCharm IDE
+ Light Weight Python IDE
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Sublime Text
5. Python IDLE
6. Notepad ++

Use Any of them as you want.
